# Complete-Pipeline-for-Training-and-Executing-ML-Models-for-Computational-Drug-Discovery

Considering the urgent necessity to circumvent the traditional constraints of time and financial investment in drug discovery, the aim of this project is to propose a novel pipeline that utilises a machine learning approach to predict novel therapeutic activities for existing drugs and natural compounds through training on existing pharmacological data. The project aims to harness data on antibacterial activity, blood-brain barrier penetrance and toxicity to discover novel safe CNS antibiotic drug candidates. A decision underpinned by the fact current treatments for CNS infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens face formidable efficacy challenges. Secondly, the choice of CNS antibiotics exemplifies the pipeline's versatility, demonstrating its capacity to identify drugs with multiple therapeutic functions. The project ultimately demonstrated that collections of decision trees, trained on chemical fingerprints and activity data, effectively predict antibiotic, non-toxic, and CNS-penetrant properties in pharmaceutical and natural compounds. This model has identified Clonazepam, typically used for seizure disorders; Disulfiram, known for treating alcohol dependence; and a novel steroid from an east-Asian fern species, as candidates exhibiting these desired activities. As well as predicting Ceftazidime, a pre-existing CNS antibiotic which further validated the applicability of this model. These compoundâ€™s predicted activities have been substantiated through extensive literature review, confirming their potential CNS-related antibacterial efficacy. Notable validations include literature by Rosa et al. (2021), which highlights Clonazepam's potential in disrupting bacterial plasmid DNA, and Meneguello et al. (2022), which demonstrates Disulfiram's effectiveness against antibiotic-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. I thus conclude that machine learning is a potent tool for predicting multifunctional therapeutic properties. Furthermore, the adaptability of this approach allows for its application across various pharmaceutical activity classes, demonstrating its broad utility in drug discovery and repurposing.
